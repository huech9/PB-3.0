      "query": "The enquirer raises concerns regarding former architect’s professional conduct and requests clarification on his registration status with LAM. There is uncertainty about his credentials, as his name does not appear on LAM’s website. If he misrepresented his practicing status, the enquirer seeks assistance in obtaining a full refund of RM6,000 paid for his services.\n\nAdditionally, the enquirer questions the necessity of a civil engineer for a minor balcony extension, which legally does not require one, and highlights that the architect’s fees were significantly higher than the market rate. The enquirer also alleges that the architect did not adhere to prior agreements, changed his approach after receiving payment, and prioritized the planning department’s requirements over the client’s instructions. The final architectural plan did not reflect the initial discussions before payment.\n\nFurthermore, the enquirer reports being subjected to wrongful enforcement actions, including harassment over essential repairs (roof, sewage, plumbing), despite informing both the architect and local authorities that extension work had been halted. The enquirer seeks a resolution to these issues, distinguishing necessary repair work from the extension dispute.\n\n(Continuation) How and where do I get justice for fraudulent practitioner like this one. He claimed to be your member. Surely you must have a procedure for members pretending to be your member’s and etc?",
      "reply": "We refer to your email received on 4.51PM, 12th March 2025 and based on the information provided, please find our response below: Status of the Individual: Based on the documents and information shared, the individual in question appears to be a registered Building Draughtsman and not a Professional Architect as defined under the Architects Act 1967. Kindly note that the Pertubuhan Akitek Malaysia (PAM) only maintains records of its own members, which include architects, graduate and student architects. We do not register Building Draughtsmen, and to our knowledge, this individual is not a member of PAM. To check his LAM registration no. or verify his registration status and credentials, we recommend referring directly to Lembaga Arkitek Malaysia (LAM) via their official website at www.lam.gov.my or by contacting them at info@lam.gov.my.\n\nScope of PAM’s Authority: As a professional institute, PAM is not empowered to intervene in private financial matters or assist in the claiming of refunds. If you believe that there has been a breach of agreement or misrepresentation, we recommend you address the matter directly with the individual concerned, or alternatively, seek legal advice if necessary. You may also consult with LAM for their advice.\n\nScope of Services and Local Authority Matters: As we are unaware of the terms and conditions agreed between the building draughtsman and yourself, we are unable to comment on the specific scope of services, fees or communications between the both of you. Any dealings or correspondence with the local authority would similarly fall outside PAM’s purview.\n\nRequirement for Structural Engineer: With respect to your query on the involvement of a civil or structural engineer, please be informed that for submission of building plans under By-law 3 of the Uniform Building (Negeri Sembilan) By-laws 1986, structural plans and calculations, in compliance of By-law 16, must be submitted prior to construction. These documents must be prepared by a registered structural engineer, regardless of the size of the proposed works. Therefore, the requirement for a structural engineer is a legal requirement and not at the discretion of the draughtsman or architect. If you have further queries on this issue, we advise you to consult the local authority.\n\nAdditional Response (25th March 2025): We refer to the following; Your initial query as received on the 12th March 2025. Our reply dated 25th March 2025. Your latest query in response to our above reply, as received on the 25th March 2025. Based on your information dated 12 March 2025, the individual appears to be a registered Building Draughtsman. The provided business card indicates \"Pelukis Pelan Bangunan / Building Draughtman (sic)\" with a Lembaga Arkitek Malaysia (LAM) registration number, i.e. BD/xx. As previously stated in our email on 25 March 2025, Pertubuhan Akitek Malaysia (PAM) maintains only a list of its members and does not register Building Draughtsmen. Regulatory matters regarding Building Draughtsmen under the Architects Act 1967 are managed by LAM. LAM's contact details were provided in our earlier email. PAM can and does act against its members who breach our Constitution and By-laws. However, our authority does not extend beyond our membership. PAM's procedures include lodging police reports or taking legal action if there is firsthand knowledge and evidence of fraudulent use of the Institute's name or intentional harm caused to the Institute. If you have firsthand knowledge and evidence of any deception perpetrated against yourself, we advise you consider lodging a police report. If you have incurred financial loss due to a breach of any agreement with the individual, we suggest seeking legal advice to pursue damages."

      "category": "Architect's Practice",
      "query": "On 22 January 2025, the enquirer made a payment of RM3,500 for \"Architectural consultancy services for submission to authority drawings and administrative work.\" The architect initially assured that he would handle all necessary approvals, including obtaining neighbour consent, before payment was made. However, after payment, the architect is now demanding an additional RM500 plus 8% SST for miscellaneous supplementary and additional services. These include transportation, client advising, site suitability assessment, addressing neighbour complaints, and previous site visits. Additionally, the architect has added RM811.40 (excluding SST) for: RM500 lump sum for supplementary/additional services, RM136 for cukai tanah (land tax) 2025, RM175.40 for cukai pintu (assessment tax) 2025. Total: RM876.31 (including SST). The enquirer had asked multiple times whether updated cukai tanah and cukai pintu were required, but received no response and assumed they were not necessary since the architect had taken over from a previous professional. The enquirer argues that, due to the architect’s failure to request these documents earlier, the additional costs should not be borne by the client. Issues Raised: Failure to obtain neighbour consent as initially promised; Demand for additional charges post-payment; Lack of communication regarding additional costs; Delayed engagement; Sudden demand for extra charges. Requested Outcome: No additional charges beyond those officially required; Assurance that the architect fulfils his obligations; Consideration of the extension requests; Clarification on fees. The enquirer seeks intervention to ensure the architect honours the agreed scope of work and does not impose unjustified additional charges.",
      "reply": "We refer to your email received on 4.28PM, 12th March 2025. While some parts of your message are unclear, we will do our best to assist based on the information provided. Please refer to our feedback as follows:\n\nRole of PAM and LAM: Pertubuhan Akitek Malaysia (PAM) is a professional institute for architects, comprising registered architects, graduates, and students. PAM’s role is to support its members and the public on professional matters within the scope of our Constitution and By-Laws. However, PAM is not a regulatory authority and is not empowered to enforce the Architects Act 1967 amongst architects, nor to intervene in commercial agreements or project-specific disputes between clients and their architects. In contrast, Lembaga Arkitek Malaysia (LAM), the statutory body established under the Architects Act 1967 is the main party responsible for regulating architects and their professional conduct under the above Act. If your concern involves possible misconduct under the Act, you may refer your complaint to LAM at www.lam.gov.my.\n\nArchitect’s Scope of Work and Fees: An architect’s duties and fees are based on the scope of services agreed between the client and the Architect. Any supplementary services not included in the original appointment - such as additional site visits, liaising with neighbours, or handling new requirements - may incur additional fees. Please note that government charges and disbursements, such as cukai tanah, cukai pintu, and local authority submission fees, are typically to be borne by the client, unless otherwise stated in writing.\n\nDesign and Authority Requirements: While an architect may offer design proposals, the final approval for any extension or renovation lies with the local authority. Approval depends on compliance with current planning and building regulations. If you have concerns about what is permissible, we recommend you consulting directly with local authorities.\n\nOn Complaints and Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR): If your concern involves a dispute with your Architect, we suggest reviewing the terms of engagement to determine what services were agreed upon and what provisions exist for dispute resolution. Should you still intend lodging a complaint against one of our members for a possible breach of our constitution or by-laws, you may submit your formal complaint to complaint@pam.org.my. We hope the above has been of assistance."

I hope you can provide a feedback as to how to tackle these items, especially the first matter since we have been asked to submit our fee proposal taking into account the performance bond. Is it legal for clients to impose a performance bond on the architects? If it is not legal, what facts can be presented to the client to counter / prevent the enforcement of a performance bond on the architects? Can a retention sum be imposed on the architect's fees as practiced on the contractor? What facts can be presented to the client to counter said practice on architects? I thank you in advance for your kind assistance on the matter.",
      "reply": "Thank you for your enquiry dated 15 January 2025. We reply as follows: Please note that there are no provisions under the Architects Act 1967 or the Architects (Scale of Minimum Fees) Rules 2010 that mandate or regulate the imposition of a performance bond or retention sum on Architects. These practices are not customary or consistent with established norms for professional architectural services. As the terms of engagement between an Architect and a client are private and subject to mutual agreement, we advise exercising caution and seeking professional advice - legal or financial - before accepting such terms, as they may have significant implications for your practice. We trust the above has been of assistance."

As far as we are aware though, there are no restrictions placed by the above documents on the currency to be used for the invoicing/charging for the above services. Nevertheless, please be reminded that there are other legal and financial requirements which may need to be considered such as the imposition and declaration of service tax, the declaration of income to the Inland Revenue Board and the handling of overseas funds including their receipt and transfer for example.

      "reply": "We refer to your enquiry as received on the 25th November 2024. Apart from the information provided by our members for inclusion in the PAM Directory, the Institute does not maintain a database of project types undertaken by its members. We also wish to highlight that PAM, including its Practice Bureau, adheres to a policy of impartiality and does not recommend or endorse specific architects for any projects. Therefore, we regret being unable to provide names of architectural practices specializing in space planning for the cinema industry in Malaysia. As an alternative, you may consider reaching out to cinema operators, their specialist consultants, suppliers, or contractors for recommendations. Given that cinemas are typically located in shopping malls, contacting mall developers for insights on professional consultants they’ve worked with may also be helpful. Additionally, some Malaysian architects specializing in this field have an online presence, which you might find useful to explore."

Is there any situation the Majlis can process the drawings without a letter of release. What action can we take against the new submitting person and Majlis if in the event Majlis proceed with processing the plan without the letter of release.",
      "reply": "Thank you for your enquiry dated 23rd October 2024 concerning the requirement for a Letter of Release (LOR) and actions by the local authority in cases where project submission is undertaken by a new Architect. With reference to the limited information provided in the query and guided by the LAM General Circular No. 3/2023, please find our response as follows:\n\nAccording to the Circular, obtaining an LOR is mandatory when a project transitions from one Architect to another. This requirement safeguards the professional responsibilities, intellectual property rights, and liabilities of the original Architect until an LOR is issued. Therefore, subject to the conditions stipulated in the Circular, an LOR must be obtained before a new Architect can submit any work on an ongoing project. However, the Circular applies solely to the conduct of LAM-registered Architects and does not impose any obligations on local authorities. There is no specific law or regulation that governs the responsibility of the local authority (LA) regarding the LOR in project submissions; thus, we are not in a position to respond to your queries concerning the actions of the LA.\n\nWe recommend that the original Architect proactively inform and communicate with the LA, briefly outlining the guidelines under the Circular and requesting the LA’s guidance on handling submissions in such cases. If the original Architect has clear evidence that his/her rights have been compromised by the acceptance of a new submission without an LOR, he/she may consider filing a formal complaint with the LA, outlining the specific professional concerns involved. Where appropriate, seeking legal advice can provide further support in safeguarding the original Architect's rights and interests in this matter. Additionally, if the new submission contravenes the Circular, the original Architect may file a formal disciplinary complaint with LAM, enabling LAM to investigate and take any necessary disciplinary action against the new Architect. We hope this response provides the clarity and direction needed."

We are a subcommittee under a Resident Association who is trying to find a solution for especially traffic flow from an up and coming new building in PJ. We are trying to find an architect to give us pro bono advise against the developer and the city council on what can or cannot be done.",
      "reply": "Thank you for your enquiry, received on 30th September 2024. We understand that your subcommittee, under the Resident Association, was seeking advice regarding traffic flow concerns related to a new development in PJ and exploring the possibility of obtaining pro bono architectural advice. As the query provided was brief and lacked supporting details, we will offer general guidance based on the available information. Firstly, it is important to note that the Malaysian Institute of Architects (Pertubuhan Akitek Malaysia, or PAM) is a private institute representing architects in Malaysia. While PAM is committed to supporting community efforts, we are not in a position to recommend specific architects or consultants for individual projects, whether pro bono or paid. Should your subcommittee wish to engage architectural services, we advise you to refer to the list of registered architects available through Lembaga Arkitek Malaysia (LAM), the statutory body responsible for regulating the architectural profession in Malaysia. This will ensure you work with architects who are properly accredited and qualified. In relation to pro bono services, it is important to note that such services are generally intended for individuals or groups facing financial hardship, as outlined by LAM’s guidelines. We recommend consulting LAM to determine whether pro bono architectural services would be appropriate in your case. Lastly, we suggest maintaining open communication with your local city council, as they hold authority over development matters, including traffic management. The city council is best positioned to provide insights on compliance with local traffic regulations and to advise on potential mitigation measures. Through these discussions, your subcommittee will gain a clearer understanding of the issues at hand and be able to determine the appropriate type of consultant or advisor for your objectives. We hope this information proves helpful and wish you success in addressing the concerns raised."

I would like to enquire as to whether all Architects in Malaysia are required to be registered and have professional indemnity Insurance? Also, what are the general requirements for engagement?",
      "reply": "We refer to your email dated 13 May 2024. Our response is as follows: According to Section 7(a) of the Architects Act 1967, only an architect who is registered with the Board of Architects Malaysia (LAM) is entitled to render architectural consultancy services. Therefore, in response to your inquiry, all architects are required to be registered in Malaysia. Regarding professional indemnity insurance, it is not mandatory for architects in Malaysia. It is optional and depends on the project’s requirements and the agreement between the architect and their employer. All Architects are required to always abide by the Architects Act 1967 (Act 117) and Architects Rules made under the Act in providing their architectural services and it is mandatory under the Act for the appointment of an Architect to be made in accordance with the Third Schedule of Architects Rules 1996 – Conditions of Engagement of an Architect.

I am writing to seek clarification regarding the responsibilities of architects under the building regulations applicable in Sabah in 2019, particularly in relation to the Occupancy Certificate (OC) issued for Project A on October 2, 2019. [Detailed query about PSP responsibility, Sabah Building By-Laws, and falsified survey details] ... (Continuation from query submitted on 9 April 2025) Thank you for your response dated 21.4.2025, which I have noted with appreciation. Regarding the “falsified survey plan,” I confirm that I reported this issue, supported by relevant drawings, to the Sabah Surveyors Board over two years ago. Additionally, I have lodged a complaint with the Board of Architects Malaysia (LAM), which is currently under investigation. I understand that your response is provided as general clarification. In this context, I have one general question: Is the amended development plan typically prepared before or after the completion of the final as-built survey?",
      "reply": "We refer to your query dated 9 April 2025 regarding the responsibilities of the Principal Submitting Person (PSP), in particular in relation to the issuance of the Occupancy Certificate (OC) for the project you have mentioned, and the submission of related plans under the applicable building by-laws in Sabah at the time. We provide the following feedback: Role of the PSP and Regulatory Framework: Under the regulatory framework in force in Sabah in 2019, a PSP—typically a registered architect—was responsible for submitting the requisite building plans and documents to the local authority in accordance with the statutory requirements then in effect. The OC, however, is issued at the discretion of the local authority upon satisfaction of applicable conditions and submission of relevant certifications.\n\nCoordination with Other Professionals: It is standard industry practice for PSPs to coordinate the submission of documents prepared by other qualified professionals, such as engineers and licensed land surveyors. The PSP relies in good faith on the competency and statutory responsibility of these professionals for the content and accuracy of their respective documents.\n\nAllegation of Falsified Survey Plan: We note your reference to a “falsified survey plan.” As this is a serious allegation and no documentary evidence was enclosed, we are not in a position to comment on the specifics of the matter. Should you have concerns regarding the authenticity or accuracy of a survey plan, we recommend that you consider referring the matter to the Sabah Surveyors Board.\n\nScope of PAM’s Role: PAM is a professional institute... We are not a regulatory, investigative, or disciplinary body... Our response is intended as a general clarification only."

      "reply": "We refer to your email dated 25th November 2024 and have outlined the following points for your consideration based on the information provided: Water Ponding Test: A water ponding test is a widely recognized method for verifying the effectiveness of waterproofing systems in buildings. However, it is not mandatory under Malaysian laws or regulations, nor is it explicitly required for the issuance of a Certificate of Completion and Compliance (CCC). The Architect’s role concerning the CCC is primarily to certify that the Works were supervised and constructed in compliance with the Approved Plans. Supervision of the Water Ponding Test: The water ponding test is typically included in the project's technical specifications. Waterproofing Warranty: Waterproofing warranties are an industry practice, not a legal requirement. The terms and conditions are usually determined at the discretion of the Developer/Architect. Rectification of Defects: If the DLP is still valid, we advise contacting the Developer. Maintenance Considerations: Building materials are subject to wear and tear.

We acknowledge the records you attached regarding balcony glass issues, burnt power sockets, and delaminated wall finishes. Given the potential safety risks, we recommend engaging an independent professional inspection service to conduct a thorough assessment (e.g., Architect Centre Sdn Bhd).

Recently, there is an uproar from the group of owners in regards to an official statement shared by YYY project's architect firm, ZZZ Architect Sdn Bhd to address the vastly discovered hollow tiles across the residential units. The statement claims that tile hollowness is not considered a defect. We hope to seek for PAM's view in regards to the official statement shared by these professional architects. In layman's understanding, hollow tiles are definitely a defect for us.",
      "reply": "We refer to your request for our opinion as received on 6 June 2024... When referring to \"tile hollowness\", we assume it means the presence of a hollow sound when tapped. This can occur for several reasons including entrapped air, separation of membranes, or shrinking bedding. Generally, a tiled surface is meant to provide an aesthetically acceptable surface, allow drainage, prevent water penetration, and support activities. If the tiling achieves the above, the Architect's view that \"A hollow sounding tile may not mean that the tile is defective\" is not incorrect. Nevertheless, depending on the severity, it may indicate insufficient support. Should you have any reservations, we suggest that a qualified and independent professional be engaged inspect the tiles (e.g. Architect Centre)."

My question is for Phase 1, after all the works has been completed and complied to Approved Building Plan as per Phase 1, can architect issue Borang F for this phase 1 instead of Borang F1?",
      "reply": "We refer to your e-mail with regards to the Certificate of Completion and Compliance. As we have no details regarding the project title of your project submission, we assume the project is submitted under one (1) building plan. According to Street Drainage Building Act, Section 70 (21), the principal submitting person (PSP) is required to supervise the erection... to ensure that the erection is in conformity with the approved plans. In this case, the approved building plan is only one (1) submission even though there are two (2) phases. Since there is only one (1) Building Plan, only one (1) CCC can be issued out. As such, we are of the opinion that CCC (Certificate of Completion and Compliance) or Borang F cannot be issued unless the whole project is completed. Further to this, Housing Development Act Section 3 clearly stated Certificate of Completion and Compliance for housing development does not include Partial certificate of completion and compliance(Form F1). A proficient resolution to address this matter involves pursuing an amendment to the building plan, thereby bifurcating the project into two phases and corresponding building plans."

Clause 30(2) further stipulates that the Developer’s architect must certify that the defects have been remedied before the release of the retention.

First Incident - Consequential Damage Due to Non-Compliance with Drawings... Who is obligated to bear the costs of all consequential damages resulting from such defects? Second Incident - Further Leakage Detected (Post-DLP)... As the DLP has expired, can we proceed to engage a third-party specialist to rectify this latent defect and recover the associated costs from the original contractor?",
      "reply": "We refer to your email dated 25th November 2024... Consequential Losses and PAM Contract 2006: The PAM Contract 2006 does not address claims for consequential losses from defects. Such claims are usually pursued between the purchaser and developer through tort. Contractor’s Obligation for Defects: Clause 15.4 of the PAM Contract 2006 requires the contractor to rectify defects listed in the Schedule of Defects (SOD) after the DLP. If defects are not noted in the SOD, the Contractor may not need to rectify them. Employing others to rectify defects noted after the DLP and recovering those costs is beyond the provisions of the PAM Contract 2006."
